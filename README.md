# Recall AI

This project integrates AI models for the Recall AI platform. Below are the steps to set up the project and run both the backend and frontend applications.

## Codebase

You can view the codebase [here](https://github.com/pankajexpressian/recall_ai/tree/Recall_AI).

## Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pankajexpressian/recall_ai.git
```

After cloning, switch to the `Recall_AI` branch:

```bash
git checkout Recall_AI
```

## Running the Backend

### Step 1: Navigate to the `recall_ai.api` directory

```bash
cd recall_ai.api
```

### Step 2: Build and run the .NET application

To build the backend application, run:

```bash
dotnet build
```

Then, to start the backend application:

```bash
dotnet run
```

## Running the Frontend

### Step 1: Navigate to the `recall_ai_ui` directory

Open a new terminal window and change to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd recall_ai_ui
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies using:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Run the frontend application

To start the frontend application, use the following command:

```bash
ng serve --port=4200
```

## Running the Python Application

### Flask Application with Hugging Face Integration

This application provides two endpoints:
- `/get_embedding`: Returns embeddings for input sentences.
- `/search-notes`: Searches diary entries based on user queries, utilizing Hugging Face's language model.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- A Hugging Face API token

### File Location

Code files are available under `recall_ai.api/Core`.

### Setup

1. **Open the Core folder in VS Code** and follow the steps below.

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies and run the following commands in the terminal:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

   Activate the virtual environment:

   - **On Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **On macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure a `requirements.txt` file exists with the following dependencies:

   ```plaintext
   flask
   torch
   transformers
   langchain
   langchain-core
   langchain-huggingface
   huggingface_hub
   ```

   Then, install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Hugging Face Authentication**

   Youâ€™ll need a Hugging Face API token to access models.
   Go to appsettings.json under recall_ai.api project and replace token in the ApiKey of HuggingFace.
   
5. **Run the Application**

   With the virtual environment activated, start the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python embeddings.py
   ```

   The server will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

### Step 5: Access the Application

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4200` to interact with the fully functional application.

## Usage

### 1. Test the `/get_embedding` Endpoint

Send a `POST` request with a JSON payload containing sentences to receive embeddings.

**Example Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/get_embedding -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"sentences\": [\"This is a test sentence.\"]}"
```

**Expected Response:**

```json
{
  "embeddings": [[...]]
}
```

### 2. Test the `/search-notes` Endpoint

Send a `POST` request to search diary entries based on a query, with authentication to Hugging Face.

**Example Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/search-notes -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"query\": \"search text\", \"diary_entries\": [\"entry 1\", \"entry 2\"], \"huggingface_token\": \"your_token_here\"}"
```

**Expected Response:**

```json
{
  "result": "Generated response based on notes and query"
}
```

### 3. Music recommendation feature

To use the music recommendation feature in the app, please register on the Spotify Developer Console, as this application operates within the development sandbox environment.
