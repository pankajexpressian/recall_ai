# Recall AI

This project integrates AI models for the Recall AI platform. Below are the steps to set up the project and run both the backend and frontend applications.

## Codebase

You can view the codebase [here](https://github.com/pankajexpressian/recall_ai/tree/AIModels).

## Cloning the Repository

To clone the repository, use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pankajexpressian/recall_ai.git
```

After cloning, switch to the `AIModels` branch:

```bash
git checkout AIModels
```

## Running the Backend

### Step 1: Navigate to the `recall_ai.api` directory

```bash
cd recall_ai.api
```

### Step 2: Build and run the .NET application

To build the backend application, run:

```bash
dotnet build
```

Then, to start the backend application:

```bash
dotnet run
```

## Running the Frontend

### Step 1: Navigate to the `recall_ai_ui` directory

Open a new terminal window and change to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd recall_ai_ui
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies using:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 3: Run the frontend application

To start the frontend application, use the following command:

```bash
ng serve --port=4200
```

### Step 4: Access the Application

Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:4200` to interact with the fully functional application.
